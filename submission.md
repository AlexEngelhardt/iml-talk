# Submission Title

Interpretable Machine Learning: How to make black box models explainable

# Talk â€“ 30 minutes

# Abstract as a Tweet

In this talk, we'll find out how to interpret the predictions of otherwise black-box models.

# Abstract

Complex machine learning models make better predictions, but at the cost of turning into an unexplainable black-box model. In this talk, we'll look into a framework that allows us to explain why a model makes a specific prediction.

# Description

We all love linear regression for its interpretability: Increase square
meters by 1, that leads to rent going up by 8 euros. A human can easily
understand why this model made a certain prediction.

Complex machine learning models like tree aggregates or neural networks
usually make better predictions, but this comes at a price: it's hard to
understand these models.

In this talk, we'll look at a few methods to pry open these models and gain
some insights 
   
Specifically, the topics covered are

- What makes a model interpretable?
  - Linear models, trees, decision rules
- The SIPA framework (Sampling, Intervention, Prediction, Aggregation) for making models interpretable again
- Model-agnostic methods for interpretability
  - Partial dependence plots (PDPs)
  - Individual conditional expectations (ICEs)
- Example-based explanations
- The future of machine learning

# Notes

- This talk builds on Christoph Molnar's book "Interpretable Machine
  Learning", available online for free:
  https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book
  This book is based on R, my talk is an adaptation to Python
- The SIPA framework is described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03959.pdf
- I might be able to extend this talk to 45 minutes if that fits better in
  your organizing, but I'd prefer to keep it at 30 minutes.
